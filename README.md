## Verifiable Credentials Data Model and Representations

Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are 
used to assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, 
university degrees can be used to assert our level of education, 
and government-issued passports enable us to travel between countries. 
This specification provides a mechanism to express these sorts of 
credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, 
privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.

We encourage contributions meeting the [Contribution
Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).  While we prefer the creation of issues
and Pull Requests in the GitHub repository, discussions often occur
on the
[public-vc-wg](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-wg/)
mailing list as well.
